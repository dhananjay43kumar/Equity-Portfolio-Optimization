# Equity-Portfolio-Optimization

“Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a hypothesis put forth by Harry Markowitz in his paper [“Portfolio Selection](https://www.math.ust.hk/~maykwok/courses/ma362/07F/markowitz_JF.pdf),” (published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance) is an investment theory based on the idea that risk-averse investors can construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment.

We already know we can calculate average returns and the volatility of a stock. We can also use the ratio between these two (along with the risk-free rate of return) .

But what if we want a portfolio of multiple stocks, how much of our cash should we put into each holding. Evenly split it between the securities? Is there a way to use historical data to indicate how we should weigh our holdings? If so, is there an optimal weighting based on history?

Here is the general idea Markowitz had:
***We can use historical returns and volatility data to decide on how much we should weigh each holding in our portfolio. We want to choose an optimal weighting that maximizes returns vs. the risk we are willing to take.***

There are different ways of coming up with these optimal weightings. Let's try the simplest method first, equally weighing all the potential holdings.
